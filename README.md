## Messaging App Project

This is the parent repository for the Full Stack Messaging App Project built for the [Odin Project Curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/nodejs-messaging-app).

The goal of the project was to build a messaging web app that allows users to send and receive real-time messages.

A restful API was built using ExpressJS and serves as the project's backend.

An intuitive User Interface was built using ReactJS and serves as the project's frontend.

The Socket.IO library was used for the real-time communication functionality between the project's client and server.
